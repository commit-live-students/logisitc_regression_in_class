In this session we'll  explore how to build a predictive model for classification problems. In classification, our target column has a finite set of possible values which represent different categories a row can belong to. We'll focus on a classification technique called logistic regression.

## Project 
Lending club dataset

To perform Logistic Regression task we will use Loan Prediction dataset.

This dataset contains following features:

* Applications Numbers that came
* Co-application
* Loan Amount
* Loan Amount term
* Credit History
* Loan Status

Target Variable:

Loan Status
